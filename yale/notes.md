microfilmlist-clean.html has had the <strong> and <span> elements removed (by text search and replace) so as to normalize the entries and make it easier to detect <dl> elements embedded in other <dl> elements

It has also had a couple of rogue embedded <dl> elements removed.

microforms-clean.csv contains the cleaned-up data: 

- fixed any problems with parsing
- split a couple of collections that contained both fiches and reels

This leaves 31 with no counts or units
